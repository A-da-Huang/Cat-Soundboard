# 🎵 Cat-Soundboard
Cat Soundboard is an interactive, keyboard controlled soundboard built with p5.js that combines sound effects with simple animations. Each key press plays a sound and controls the cat to move it's arm.

## Overview
This was created by me during my Creative Coding class as a final project. One of the requirements for this final was to be able to incorporate anything outside of just keyboard and mouse. For this project I decided to go with a macro pad from [pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow-2040?variant=39328275300435)
